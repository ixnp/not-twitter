# not-twitter


##You are going to build out a twitter clone, but for one userâ€¦ who talks to themselves.
* The page should display the user's name and avatar 
* On load, you should see all of the users previous posts.
* Each post has content, a number of likes, and comments.
* When the likes are clicked the number of likes should increase on the page and persist on refresh.
* The comments should be listed under each post, with their content and their own likes button.
* A user should be able to add Posts to their profile and comments to their posts that persist in the database.
